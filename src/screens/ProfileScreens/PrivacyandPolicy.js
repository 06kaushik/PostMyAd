                            At SAPS.ai, we believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.


                        </Text>
                        <Text style={styles.content1}>We encourage you to read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you take away from it:

                        </Text>
                        <Text style={styles.content2}>1.	SAPS.ai is a public domain and its content is immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world. You can also use SAPS.ai under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.
                            2.	When you use SAPS.ai, even if you’re just looking at content, we receive some personal information from you like your profile, the type of device you’re using and your IP address. You can choose to share additional information with us like your address book contacts and/or a public profile. We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant content and ads, etc.
                            3.	We give you control through your settings to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it, and to control things like account security, marketing preferences and address book contacts you’ve uploaded to SAPS.ai. You can also download information you have shared on SAPS.ai.
                            4.	In addition to information you share with us, we use your activity, content you’ve read or liked and other information to determine what type of content you’re interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content. We give you transparency into that information, and you can modify or correct it at any time.
                            If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to hear from you. You can contact us at any time.</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.content3}>I.	Information You Share With Us
                            We require certain information to provide our services to you. For instance, you must have an account in order to upload or share content on SAPS.ai. When you choose to share the below information with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.</Text>
                   <Text style={styles.content4}>a.	Basic Account Information
You have to create an account to use our services. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On SAPS.ai this includes a display name, a username (for example, @SAPS.ai Influencer), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. If you choose to create a professional account, you must also provide us with your professional category, and may provide us with additional information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. In case you transact on our platform, you will have to provide Tax IDs and Goods and Service Tax IDs for regulatory and statutory compliances. You can also create and manage multiple SAPS.ai accounts for example to provide different types of content.

b.	Public Information
Most activity on SAPS.ai is public, including your profile information, your display language, when you created your account, and your content and certain information about your Content like the date, time, and application and version of SAPS.ai you are using. When you share audio or visual content on our service we may analyze that data to operate our services, for example by providing audio transcription. The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Content you Like are also public. If you like, respond to or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Broadcasts you create are public along with when you created them. Your engagement with broadcasts, including viewing, listening, commenting, speaking, reacting to, or otherwise participating in them, on SAPS.ai, is public along with when you took those actions. Any engagement with another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on our services. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public.



You are responsible for your content and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on SAPS.ai, such as by deleting Content or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on SAPS.ai., SAPS.ai for iOS, and SAPS.ai for Android.
By publicly posting content, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Content to people around the world, we use technology like  application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Content on a news website or analyzing what people say on SAPS.ai. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with SAPS.ai, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on SAPS.ai. 

c.	Contact Information and Address Books
We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. Subject to your settings, we also use contact information to enable certain account features (for example, for login verification), to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from SAPS.ai to that number as your country’s laws allow. SAPS.ai also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third- party services and client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from SAPS.ai. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.
You can choose to upload and sync your address book on SAPS.ai so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.
If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.




 

d.	Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications
We provide certain features that may let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can use Direct Messages in future to have non-public conversations on SAPS.ai. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co URLs, detection of spam, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications on SAPS.ai - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.


e.	Payment Information
You may provide us with payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address, in order to purchase advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services. If you make a payment or send money using SAPS.ai features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made or when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew.


f.	Additional Information We Receive About You
We receive certain information when you use our services or other websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with us, we use the data below to operate our services.

a.	Location Information
We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you. Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current precise position or places where you’ve previously used SAPS.ai - to operate or personalize our services including with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow
 
	

b.	Links / QR Codes
In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links/QR codes across our services. This includes links in emails we send you and links/QR codes in content that appear on screens, other websites or mobile applications. If you click on an external link/QR codes or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from SAPS.ai and/or location of screen, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.

c.	Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.

d.	Log Data
We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes SAPS.ai content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through SAPS.ai. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.

We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.

e.	SAPS.ai for Web Data
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate SAPS.ai content such as embedded timelines or content screens, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 150 days. 

f.	Advertisers and Other Ad Partners
Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of SAPS.ai. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by SAPS.ai from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with SAPS.ai and that SAPS.ai receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.

g.	Other Third Parties and Affiliates
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on SAPS.ai, partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your SAPS.ai account.
You may choose to connect your SAPS.ai account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that SAPS.ai formally supports, you may revoke this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have connected to SAPS.ai.



h.	Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity
When you log into SAPS.ai on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into SAPS.ai (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices). When you provide other information to SAPS.ai, including an email address, we associate that information with your SAPS.ai account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to SAPS.ai. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on SAPS.ai for Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email addresses containing those components.
 




1.	Information We Share and Disclose

As noted above, SAPS.ai is designed to broadly and instantly disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we do so subject to your control, because it’s important for operating our services, or because it’s required by law.

a.	Sharing You Control
We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on SAPS.ai. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from these partners, they may receive and process your personal data as described in their privacy policies.
If you do not want this content to play automatically, you can adjust your auto play settings. If you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected Content with someone else who accesses SAPS.ai through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.
Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether SAPS.ai shares your personal data in this way by using the “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” option in your Personalization and Data settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our service providers or through partnerships other than as described in our Help Center)


 



b.	Service Providers
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services for us in India and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). We share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.

c.	Law, Harm, and the Public Interest
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services8; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.

d.	Affiliates and Change of Ownership
In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.

e.	Non-Personal Information
We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with your content, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll, the topics that people are following about in a particular location, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.







2.	Managing Your Personal Information With Us
You control the personal data you share with us. You can access or rectify this data at any time. You can also deactivate your account. We also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where applicable for the use of data you have provided to SAPS.ai. And we make the data you shared through our services portable and provide easy ways for you to contact us. Please note, to help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with deletion, portability, or other related requests.

b.	Deletion

For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your SAPS.ai account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.

c.	Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent
When you are logged into your SAPS.ai account, you can manage your privacy settings and other account features here at any time. It may take a short amount of time for privacy settings to be fully reflected throughout our systems.

3.	Children and Our Services
Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 18. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf)


4.	Our Global Operations and Data Transfers

To bring you our services, we operate globally. Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in India and any other country where we operate. In some of the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of your country. 
 



5.	Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be at https://SAPS.ai.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you within SAPS.ai.com, SAPS.ai for iOS, or SAPS.ai for Android, via a SAPS.ai owned and operated SAPS.ai account (for example @SAPS.aiSupport), or by sending an email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
